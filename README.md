# The Marketplace
Unfortunately I'm not at liberty to publish the code for this project, but here is a [Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ncnuBWo3kSq-8CRagExZeWKNIxuXB-Di/view?usp=sharing)!

## About
This project was a team effort from my 3 teammates and I who developed a prototype Java GUI that could provide a service similar to Amazon's web app for its users. It's comprised of two interfaces, for the 'sellers' and 'buyers', who - after logging in - are able to do a wide variety of things. For the sellers, they can create a storefront in which to showcase their products, promote discounts, and keep track of their sales. For the buyers, they can add products being sold to their carts, maintain their cart and buying history within their account, and contact sellers.
